I found Schein’s discussion on the role of the founders particularly intriguing, as there are several ways to apply his findings (1983). There is the historical context as well as more current applications of his theory on founding leadership.\nFor instance, Schein (1983) outlines four distinct steps that demonstrate how founding has a lasting impact on the culture of the firm. In the case of the United States, George Washington is the figurehead that most clearly represents the first step, an “idea for a new enterprise:” an independent country of distinct but united states. Then, according to Schein, “a founding group is created on the initial consensus that the idea is a good one,” a group of colonial leaders appropriately known as The Founding Fathers. Next, this group acts “in concert to create the organization,” which this set of founders did by crafting and signing the Declaration of Independence, and later drafting and adopting the Constitution. Schein’s final step, bringing others on board to begin functioning and “developing its own history,” is portrayed in our country’s 234 rich and colorful years of existence. The cultural theme of separate and unique, yet united, parts permeates this history: the structure of government, the diversity among the roles and occupations of the Founding Fathers, as well as our demographic diversity here in “the Melting Pot.” This notable founding and the resulting culture is a familiar example for many of us of Schein’s discussion of initial leaders and their impact.\nAnother way to consider founding leadership in the U.S. is in terms of each president and his administration. Every time a new commander-in-chief is elected, a new administration is appointed and a new Congress is elected, essentially re-creating and re-founding the country under new leadership. In our current situation, most would agree that Obama exemplifies qualities of a charismatic and visionary leader, as we have discussed extensively in class. During his initial campaign, he was massively successful in mobilizing people and garnering commitment, and has since set up a founding group of his own within his Cabinet, as well as the Congress he works alongside. In the current political climate, midterm elections, which could drastically impact is core group of “founders,” will be a critical moment in the Obama’s success as an organizational leader.\nQuestions:\n- Has Obama’s four years in office been consistent with the culture established by The Founding Fathers? Why or why not?\n- Do you think Obama will ultimately be successful in establishing a resounding legacy? (Some particular “hot issues” to consider are health care reform and the economy.)\n- What other points from Schein’s article could be applied United States’ government?\nFirst Ladies: Public Servants or Positional Powerhouses??\n\"\n\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":52},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's add the re-ranking","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"corpus_ids, _ = index.knn_query(query_embedding.cpu(), k=128)\n\nmodel_inputs = [(query, contexts[idx]) for idx in corpus_ids[0]]\ncross_scores = xenc_model.predict(model_inputs)\n\nprint(\"Cross-encoder model re-ranking results\")\nprint(f\"Query: \\\"{query}\\\"\")\nprint(\"---------------------------------------\")\nfor idx in np.argsort(-cross_scores)[:3]:\n    print(f\"Score: {cross_scores[idx]:.4f}\\nDocument: \\\"{contexts[corpus_ids[0][idx]]}\\\"\\n\\n\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-22T08:15:34.087942Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-22T08:15:34.088141Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-22T08:15:34.497799Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-22T08:15:34.088127Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-22T08:15:34.497122Z"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Batches:   0%|          | 0/4 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"6ac773184de5498d914f95d912e6aa16"}},"metadata":{}},{"name":"stdout","text":"Cross-encoder model re-ranking results\nQuery: \"Who is the president of the United States?\"\n---------------------------------------\nScore: 0.7632\nDocument: \"Why It Makes A Difference!\nThe President of the United States is a liar.

It is because the leader of the Free World MUST be Trusted. When the President of the United States is willing to repeatedly Testify to lies, then who should our Children look up to? Sports Figures? When everyone within the Obama Administration is willing to SAY and do anything regardless of TRUTH, then why would anyone in the WORLD believe in America or Her Freedoms.\nThe recent admission to IRS intimidation against “Tea Party” shows the level of tyrannical Leadership that Mr. Obama is willing to stoop. With the passage of the Obama Care TAX legislation, imagine the CONTROL that our Massive “Progressive” Government will inflict on the Freedoms guaranteed to AMERICAN Citizens by Crushing the Constitution and Bill of Rights through a Tyrannical Regulatory State.\nWhy does it make a Difference when I have lost Faith in the Government of the People, when the President of the United States is Liar, manipulator and Sociopathic Collective Salvation Freak?

Otherwise, it is impossible to explain why the left fears (and the right hopes) that Barack Obama (or perhaps even John McCain) will be up to his neck in the economic crisis for months and will be unavailable for dipping in the Middle Eastern swamp. By that time the Likud will have established a government of refusal, or perhaps a unity government, i.e., a government of paralysis. The traditional Jewish lobby will see to it that Obama will not hassle Benjamin Netanyahu (or perhaps after all the prime minister will be Tzipi Livni) about Jerusalem and the Jewish settlements in the West Bank. And a savior has come to Zion.\nIntensive care for the Israeli-Arab conflict need not necessarily interfere with rescuing the economy; rather, political and security stability in this irritable region could also contribute to soothing the markets. However, the decision to postpone until better days dealing with the regional crisis works to the advantage of those elements that will exploit stasis to ensure the coming days will be worse. \"Our\" conflict resembles a car in which the transmission offer a choice between driving onward or retreating in reverse. Our leaders have, after all, taught us that a truce enables terror organizations to get organized and arm themselves in advance of the next round.\nIn the zero-sum game between Fatah and Hamas, any hiatus in the diplomatic talks to advance the end of the occupation strengthens the elements that propose the alternative of violence to obtain the same aim. The decision by the American president to sit on the fence will tear the pants of proponents of a two-state solution.\nObama's slogan, \"Change We Need,\" is especially apt with regard to American policy in the Middle East. The new menu has been waiting since December 2006, for the president who will know how to draw the correct conclusions from the \"axis of evil\" policy and \"the democratization of the Middle East.\" This is detailed in the report submitted to Congress and the current U.S. president by James Baker (secretary of state and White House chief of staff for George Bush Sr.) and Lee Hamilton, chair of the Congressional Foreign Affairs Committee on behalf of the Democrats. The team of experts they headed pointed to a direct connection between the Israeli-Arab conflict and other problems in the Middle East, such as dealing with the regimes in Iran and in Syria. The U.S. cannot achieve its aims in the Middle East without dealing directly with the Arab-Israeli conflict, they said. They recommended taking action to establish a regional framework to support the stabilization of Iraq, which would include the neighboring Arab countries. Another recommendation was that the U.S. find a way to enter into a dialogue with Syria and even with Iran, as they border on Iraq and constitute a necessary factor in stabilizing it. Even though the experts acknowledged the problematics of dialogue with Iran, they note that Afghanistan had cooperated with the United States.\nObama will have at his disposal a very important tool for implementing the recommended change; Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has related that after Obama received an explanation of the Arab peace initiative of 2002, he said that it was madness on Israel's part to have missed that opportunity. Indeed, it is hard to think of any move that would isolate Iran and embarrass Hamas and Hezbollah more than a regional peace agreement and two American embassies in Jerusalem, in the western part for Israel and in the eastern part for Palestine. Recently the Arab initiative has found favor among senior elements in Israel, led by the president and by the leaders of Kadima and of Labor. It will not wait forever for an Israeli partner..\nThe new president will be sworn in not long before the citizens of Israel go to the polls. They deserve to know what Middle East policy the new prime minister they are about to elect will encounter when he (or she) comes to visit the White House.
