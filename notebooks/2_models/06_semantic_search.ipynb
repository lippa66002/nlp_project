      "Created by 2010 General Assembly vote, committee will pick two nominees for 2017 UUA presidential election.\n",
      "That system is changing. In 2010, the General Assembly approved the creation of a Presidential Search Committee and charged it with selecting at least two nominees for president. The General Assembly also shortened the president's term of office from two four-year terms to a single six-year term.\n",
      "Members of the search committee were selected in 2013. This spring they are exploring how a system might be created that would be open to more people. \"The goal of the committee is to not just select candidates,\" said the Rev. Dr. Matthew Johnson, co-chair, \"but to think creatively and systematically about what the job entails and to broaden the circle of people willing to consider this opportunity.\"\n",
      "\"I've seen the presidency just take a toll on the people who have occupied it,\" Johnson said. \"In part that's because it has not been clear about what is and is not part of the job.\"\n",
      "So the committee is creating a job description. \"Currently there isn't one,\" said Johnson. \"There are references scattered throughout the UUA bylaws, but nothing more than a line here and there—that the president shall act as CEO, shall serve on this or that committee, or make appointments to other committees. One of the things we're determining is: What is the job? What cannot be delegated?\"\n",
      "The committee has seven members. Johnson is senior minister of the UU Church of Rockford, Ill. Liz Jones, the other co-chair, is director of religious education and family ministry at First UU Church of San Diego. The Rev. Dr. Michael Tino is minister of the UU Fellowship of Northern Westchester in Mt. Kisco, N.Y. Elandria Williams, a member of Tennessee Valley UU Church in Knoxville, Tenn., is an educator at the Highlander Research and Education Center in New Market, Tenn. Jacqui C. Williams, a member of First UU Society of Albany, N.Y., is an anti-oppression consultant and founder of Filling in the Gaps in American History. The Rev. Wayne Arnason is co-minister of West Shore UU Church in Rocky River, Ohio. The Rev. Joanna Fontaine Crawford is a minister at First UU Church of Houston, Tex.\n",
      "\"We have a wide variety of experience,\" said Johnson. \"We're balanced geographically and we represent small to large congregations.\" The Board of Trustees named Jones and Fontaine Crawford to the committee. The others were selected by the UUA Nominating Committee and elected by the General Assembly. They will each serve a six-year term.\n",
      "To develop the job description, committee members are talking with former presidents and runners-up as well as former moderators. They will also be in touch with about thirty stakeholder groups.\n",
      "The committee met for the first time in October 2013. It will meet three times a year in person and monthly by phone. In May, it will meet in Houston to draft the job description, which will be discussed at a workshop at the General Assembly in Providence, R.I., in June and presented online. The work of the committee can be followed through its blog, UUA Presidential Search Committee. All of its meetings are open to the public.\n",
      "Johnson is quick to dispel any perception that the committee was created to give certain candidates the inside track. \"That is simply not the case. We have all checked our assumptions at the door about who the nominees might be. We won't even begin to talk about names until this fall.\"\n",
      "Starting this fall through General Assembly 2015 in Portland, Ore., the committee will solicit names of potential candidates.\n",
      "Ultimately the committee will select two or more nominees for the 2017 presidential election. Other candidates may run by petition.\n",
      "Two questions loom large. The UUA has never had a female president or one who was a layperson. But that doesn't mean those two groups have an edge, said Johnson. \"No decisions have been made.\"\n",
      "The committee is also discussing campaign finance limits. \"We have presented some options to the board in regards to a top limit on fundraising—enough money to travel and pay for materials,\" said Johnson. \"It will be up to the board to decide on those limits, and up to the Election Campaign Practices Committee to enforce those limits.\" The committee also plans to suggest a limit on individual donations.\n",
      "Limiting the cost is one way to make it easier for people to run, said Johnson. Another way is to limit how much travel a candidate should have to do. \"With the way that technology has changed, we think there's a better way to campaign than to fly to 16 district meetings,\" said Johnson. \"More appearances could be made electronically.\" The committee will be reviewing campaign finance statements from the past four elections.\n",
      "What has been lacking when the UUA selects its top leadership is a sense of community and common progress, Johnson believes. \"There isn't a sense of what we are seeking together. We want the process to be driven more by the movement and less by personal interest.\"\n",

Most Americans were taught that and many (I’m certain the vast majority of my American readers) remember it. Various states have various methods for ratifying an amendment to the United States’ Constitution. The issue is who certifies that a sufficient number of states ratified the amendment? It turns out that under current law the lone and basically unchallengeable authority in the matter is the Archivist of the United States.\n",
      "Now we get into what if territory. What if a president was in their second term and wanted to stay beyond the end of it? Currently the 22nd Amendment limits a president to two terms so that amendment would have to be nullified; perhaps even to the degree to allow a president for life.\n",
      "Under the current laws that would require 327 votes in the House (assuming all 435 members were present and voting), 67 votes in the Senate (regardless of “attendance”) and ratification by 38 states. Admittedly as things stand at the moment I can’t see such an amendment making it out of either, let alone both, chambers of Congress. Nor do I see it happening in any predictable configuration of the next Congress. Considering all the things that are happening in DC which we never thought could happen in America; for the sake of this discussion let’s assume that the amendment made it out of DC and to the states.\n",
      "Under our current system if the Archivist of the United States certified that 38 states ratified the amendment that is the end of the story regardless of reality. That is a dangerous situation!\n",
      "This is not a reflection on Ferriro or his integrity. Since he took office in 2009 I see no reason to assume he is a Trump stooge or would take part in something like this. However, Trump has purged countless loyal civil servants and appointees when they did not serve his purposes. What is there to stop him from replacing Ferriro? He could then appoint another sycophant, as he has done so many times already, and if he retains just 50 seats in the Senate have them confirmed. Then if he could get the amendment through Congress the states really would not serve as a backstop.\n",
      "I’ll admit today’s scenario is a bit wild and very unlikely. Perhaps I’ve been reading a bit too much post World War I 20th century European history lately. If nothing else we have all learned a history lesson and now know that the United States has an Archivist (who actually has many more duties).\n",

      "One might think that Gerald Ford (of whom it was said that he could not walk and chew gum at the same time) is the leading candidate for president of the United States. Otherwise, it is impossible to explain why the left fears (and the right hopes) that Barack Obama (or perhaps even John McCain) will be up to his neck in the economic crisis for months and will be unavailable for dipping in the Middle Eastern swamp. By that time the Likud will have established a government of refusal, or perhaps a unity government, i.e., a government of paralysis. The traditional Jewish lobby will see to it that Obama will not hassle Benjamin Netanyahu (or perhaps after all the prime minister will be Tzipi Livni) about Jerusalem and the Jewish settlements in the West Bank. And a savior has come to Zion.\n",
      "Intensive care for the Israeli-Arab conflict need not necessarily interfere with rescuing the economy; rather, political and security stability in this irritable region could also contribute to soothing the markets. However, the decision to postpone until better days dealing with the regional crisis works to the advantage of those elements that will exploit stasis to ensure the coming days will be worse. \"Our\" conflict resembles a car in which the transmission offer a choice between driving onward or retreating in reverse. Our leaders have, after all, taught us that a truce enables terror organizations to get organized and arm themselves in advance of the next round.\n",
      "In the zero-sum game between Fatah and Hamas, any hiatus in the diplomatic talks to advance the end of the occupation strengthens the elements that propose the alternative of violence to obtain the same aim. The decision by the American president to sit on the fence will tear the pants of proponents of a two-state solution.\n",
      "Obama's slogan, \"Change We Need,\" is especially apt with regard to American policy in the Middle East. The new menu has been waiting since December 2006, for the president who will know how to draw the correct conclusions from the \"axis of evil\" policy and \"the democratization of the Middle East.\" This is detailed in the report submitted to Congress and the current U.S. president by James Baker (secretary of state and White House chief of staff for George Bush Sr.) and Lee Hamilton, chair of the Congressional Foreign Affairs Committee on behalf of the Democrats. The team of experts they headed pointed to a direct connection between the Israeli-Arab conflict and other problems in the Middle East, such as dealing with the regimes in Iran and in Syria. The U.S. cannot achieve its aims in the Middle East without dealing directly with the Arab-Israeli conflict, they said. They recommended taking action to establish a regional framework to support the stabilization of Iraq, which would include the neighboring Arab countries. Another recommendation was that the U.S. find a way to enter into a dialogue with Syria and even with Iran, as they border on Iraq and constitute a necessary factor in stabilizing it. Even though the experts acknowledged the problematics of dialogue with Iran, they note that Afghanistan had cooperated with the United States.\n",
      "Obama will have at his disposal a very important tool for implementing the recommended change; Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has related that after Obama received an explanation of the Arab peace initiative of 2002, he said that it was madness on Israel's part to have missed that opportunity. Indeed, it is hard to think of any move that would isolate Iran and embarrass Hamas and Hezbollah more than a regional peace agreement and two American embassies in Jerusalem, in the western part for Israel and in the eastern part for Palestine. Recently the Arab initiative has found favor among senior elements in Israel, led by the president and by the leaders of Kadima and of Labor. It will not wait forever for an Israeli partner..\n",
      "The new president will be sworn in not long before the citizens of Israel go to the polls. They deserve to know what Middle East policy the new prime minister they are about to elect will encounter when he (or she) comes to visit the White House. This will help them choose the direction of the change that they want at home.\"\n",
