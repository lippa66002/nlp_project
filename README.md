#  NLP Project 2024/2025

This repository demonstrates a **complete natural language processing (NLP) pipeline**, built around the [RAG-12000 dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/neural-bridge/rag-dataset-12000).  
It progresses from traditional text preprocessing and clustering to **large language model (LLM)** inference and a **voice-enabled retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** interface.

>  **Goal:** Showcase practical expertise in modern NLP — from text cleaning to semantic search and multimodal AI — using real data and state-of-the-art models.

##  Highlights

- **End-to-End NLP Pipeline:** Preprocessing → embeddings → clustering → classification → retrieval → generation → speech interface  
- **Bridging Classical & Modern NLP:** TF-IDF, GloVe, and K-Means alongside T5, Sentence-BERT, and LLaMA-2  
- **Applied LLMs:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation with T5 and fine-tuned LLaMA-2  
- **Interactive AI System:** Voice-based RAG chatbot combining Whisper (STT), Gemini via LangChain (retrieval), and Tacotron2 (TTS)  
- **Comprehensive Evaluation:** BLEU, F1, Exact Match, and Recall@K metrics to measure performance at every stage
